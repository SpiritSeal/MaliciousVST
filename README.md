# MaliciousVST
Creating Proof-of-concept malVSTs to demonstrate security weaknesses in the status quo of the plugin framework

---

At the present, I've building the proof-of-concepts by building `New Plugin` boilerplate using Steinberg's official tool, and inserting the code into the plugin constructor in the myplugincontroller.cpp file located in [Plugin Name]/Scource Files/plugincontroller.cpp of the solution.

The items in this repo are different versions of the mentioned file used for various demos. You can find the compiled versions of them in the [Compiled](Compiled) folder
