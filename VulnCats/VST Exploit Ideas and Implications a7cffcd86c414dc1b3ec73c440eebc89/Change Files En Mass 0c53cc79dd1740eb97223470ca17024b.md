Should theoretically be very possible, esp with [Arbitrary Powershell Command Execution](Arbitrary%20Powershell%20Command%20Execution%20cfcbd3c8893e437a9d54e2a42838b60c.md).

The only question would be if Antimalware Software can catch onto what is happening and attempt to do something about it.

And if it does, what software would it blame as the culprit? The VST dll or the VST host that loaded it?
