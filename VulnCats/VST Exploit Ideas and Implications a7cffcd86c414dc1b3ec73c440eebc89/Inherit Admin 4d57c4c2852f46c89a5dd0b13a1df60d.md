^^^In the above examples, we see instances of VST host users being told (or otherwise shown doing) running their VST hosts with administrator privs.

- This escalation is then inherited by the VSTs themselves, increasing the danger that can come as a result of malicious attacks through them
- This also demonstrates the lack of consumer awareness of the potential dangers that these plugins can have
