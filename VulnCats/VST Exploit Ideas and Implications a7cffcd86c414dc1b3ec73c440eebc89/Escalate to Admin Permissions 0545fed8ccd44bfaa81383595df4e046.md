# Escalate to Admin Permissions

Danger Status: Extreme
Issue Exists?: Yes
Not Malware Scope?: No
Tested?: Yes

Not directly possible, but can be attempted easily through the use of [Arbitrary Powershell Command Execution](Arbitrary%20Powershell%20Command%20Execution%20cfcbd3c8893e437a9d54e2a42838b60c.md) running Priv Escalation tools like WinPeas. Surprisingly, antiviruses fail to detect this when it occurs, even though regular WinPeas is immediately quarantined when downloaded normally (rather than this attempted fileless execution).
