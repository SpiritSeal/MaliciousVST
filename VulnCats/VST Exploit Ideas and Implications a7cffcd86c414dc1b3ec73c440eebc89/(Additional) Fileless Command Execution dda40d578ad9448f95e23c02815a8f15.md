# (Additional) Fileless Command Execution

Danger Status: Medium
Issue Exists?: Yes
Not Malware Scope?: No
Tested?: Yes

The VST plugin does not have to directly create malware files, instead opting to use [Arbitrary Powershell Command Execution](Arbitrary%20Powershell%20Command%20Execution%20cfcbd3c8893e437a9d54e2a42838b60c.md) to load malicious scripts from attacker-specified endpoints directly into memory where it can then be executed, avoiding detection from Antivirus products.
