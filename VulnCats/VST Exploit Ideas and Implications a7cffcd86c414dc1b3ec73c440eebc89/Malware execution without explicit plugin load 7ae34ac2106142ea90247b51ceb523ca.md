# Malware execution without explicit plugin load

Danger Status: Extreme
Issue Exists?: Yes
Not Malware Scope?: No
Tested?: Yes

In VST hosts that leverage an on-startup “scanning” system to detect new and modified plugins in defined plugin directories, it appears that this scanning process actually loads the VST dll as a subprocess of the host program, giving it the ability to run whatever [Arbitrary Powershell Command Execution](Arbitrary%20Powershell%20Command%20Execution%20cfcbd3c8893e437a9d54e2a42838b60c.md) it pleases without the user actively launching the program within the VST host.

For reference, here is what a VST lifecycle could look like as a result of this:

1. Convince User to download your VST plugin (mb advertise it as free or smthng)
2. Have the user save the file in their VST plugin directory.
3. The next time their open their music production software, the new plugin is detected, loaded into memory, where malware can be executed.

Here are the additional steps that would be skipped if this weakness is capitalized upon:

1. User loads the downloaded plugin into their current project

The removal of this final crucial step can allow malware to harm a user’s computer without them being able to trace back the cause of the problem to the plugin, which though downloaded, was never actually launched by them on their device.
